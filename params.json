[How?](#how)\r\n* Quality trumps size\r\n  – while 1k is a goal,\r\n  don't sacrifice looks!\r\n* You are encouraged to improve\r\n  on already submitted logos!\r\n* No raster data, `data:` urls or multi-file svgs.\r\n  * Exception: As Firefox does not\r\n    (and will not) support SVG fonts,\r\n    do link external web fonts – for text. [How?](#how)\r\n* Indent elements to show nesting depth.\r\n* Generally stick to one element per line.\r\n* Whether adding or trimming, make a pull request:\r\n  * Name it `<Logo Name>: <nnnn> bytes`\r\n  * List `original: <url>`\r\n    on the first line of your comment,\r\n    linking a version of the logo on the web.\r\n\r\n### Best practices\r\n\r\n* Since one goal is teaching, think of your commits as a step by step guide:\r\n* When optimizing, make separate commits for different operations you do.\r\n* Write good commit messages about what you did, that others can learn from.\r\n* When using tools, you are encouraged to name them in your commit messages.\r\n* If it's a command-line tool, better still:\r\n  paste your command line args further down in the message!\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n* To make an SVG scale,\r\n  make sure your `<svg>` element\r\n  has a `viewBox` attribute,\r\n  and no `width`, `height` or\r\n  [`preserveAspectRatio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio)\r\n  attributes (`xMidYMid meet`\r\n  is already the default).\r\n* If you want to link an external\r\n  WOFF font from Google, for instance,\r\n  [this way conserves size](https://github.com/johan/kilobyte-svg-challenge/commit/e6f68780dbc49dc2c48fdf73e2f2bb4f31e8365b).\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n### Drawing\r\n\r\n* [InkScape](http://inkscape.org/): a popular open source SVG editor\r\n* [SVG Edit](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html): a free web browser based SVG editor\r\n* [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html): a commercial vector graphics package from Adobe\r\n\r\n### Optimizers\r\n\r\n* [Scour](http://www.codedread.com/scour/) [[launchpad](https://launchpad.net/scour)]: a python module / script by Jeff Schiller to shrink SVG file sizes\r\n* [SVG Cleaner](http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/introducing-svg-cleaner): a similar perl script with a graphical UI wrapper\r\n* [SVG-Cleaner](https://npmjs.org/package/svg-cleaner) [[github](https://github.com/preciousforever/SVG-Cleaner)]: a javascript npm port of (parts of) Scour\r\n* [svgtidy](http://intertwingly.net/code/svgtidy/svgtidy.rb): a ruby script by Sam Ruby\r\n* [CleanSVG](http://cleansvg.codeplex.com/): a .NET windows tool by Microsoft\r\n* [SVG Optimizer](https://github.com/svg/svgo#readme):  a Nodejs-based tool by Kir Belevich\r\n* Your favourite text editor! - Emacs, vim, Textmate, et cetera all work great\r\n\r\n## Legal\r\n\r\nAll logos, copyrights,\r\ntrademarks and other legal rights\r\nto the images in this repository\r\nbelong to their respective owners,\r\nnot the people submitting\r\nvectorized versions thereof.\r\n\r\nIf you find your logo represented here\r\nand would rather have people use whatever\r\ninferior non-scalable, slow-loading,\r\npixellated raster graphics version\r\nthey find when talking about you on the web,\r\njust submit an [issue](https://github.com/johan/kilobyte-svg-challenge/issues) mentioning \"takedown\"\r\nin its title, list the url to the logo in question,\r\nand it will of course be removed from here.\r\n","tagline":"Your mission, should you choose to accept it: make your favourite logo in 1024 bytes or less.","google":"UA-36882640-1"}
